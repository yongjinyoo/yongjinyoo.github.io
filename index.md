I am a postdoctoral research fellow at Marius Wernig lab, Stanford University.

My research at Stanford University focus on the development of novel and noninvasive therapeutic method for neurodegenerative diseases using intriguing cell type of the brain, microglia. I am also interested in the understanding of molecular mechanism of neurodevelepmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder, using induced neuronal (iN) cells.
