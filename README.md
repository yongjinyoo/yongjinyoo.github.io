### I am a postdoctoral research fellow at Marius Wernig lab, Stanford University.
### My research at Stanford University focus on the development of novel and noninvasive therapeutic method for neurodegenerative diseases using intriguing cell type of the brain, microglia. I am also interested in the understanding of molecular mechanism of neurodevelepmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder, using induced neuronal (iN) cells.
